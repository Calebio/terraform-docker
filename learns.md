I normally make sure I'm conneted to my github by usin g the commands <br/>
`git config --global user.name "Caleb"`
`git config --global user.email "kalebiotezz@yahoo.com"`





`curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/public-ipv4` ==> I used this code to get the ip of a docker node/containerfter 

To run the docker image in a browser, input the ip address shown a running the about curl command and add the port number which my was 1880.
